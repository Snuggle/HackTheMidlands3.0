# HackTheMidlands3.0 - "Remind Me Bot"
This is a repo for the HackTheMidlands3.0 hackathon, this will remain private and only available to the people within our group.

Our group created a "Remind Me" SaaS ([Software-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service)) where people are able to send the bot a message asking for a reminder, and the bot would wait until that time to send a text message back, reminding the person.

**User:** `Remind Me to go to the store in 3 hours!`

**RemindMe:** `Sure! I will remind you to go to the store in 3 hours.`

*\*3 hours later\**

**RemindMe:** `Please remember to go to the store! You asked me to remind you 3 hours ago.`
